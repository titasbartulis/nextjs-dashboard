# Next.js Dashboard Application

Welcome to my project - a dashboard application built with Next.js. This project allowed me to dive deep into Next.js routing, exploring features like dynamic, nested, and catch-all routes.

## Project Overview

In this project, I've built a dashboard application using Next.js. The application allows users to navigate through different pages, with the ability to prefetch pages for faster navigation. It also handles query parameters and wildcards.

To get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## More About the Project

This project was a great learning experience for me. I've learned a lot about Next.js and its powerful routing capabilities.
